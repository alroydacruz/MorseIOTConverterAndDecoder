This **IOT** Project allows you to trasmit a secret message from the **android App** to your **raspberry pi** via the **cloud** (gcp iot core) which will blink this secret message in **Morse** using a bulb with a **relay**. The app can also decode any blinking morse code into its corresponding message using the **light sensor**, if your phone has one.
