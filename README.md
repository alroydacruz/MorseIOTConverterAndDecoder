This Project allows you to trasmit a secret message from the android App to your raspberry pi via the cloud (gcp iot core) which will blink this secret message in **Morse** using a bulb with a relay. The app also can decode any blinking morse code into its corresponding message using the light sensor, if your phone has one.
